# ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch
In this folder I carry out machine learning algorithms from first principles to improve my understanding.
This will be an ongoing project and I am hoping to cover the following:

* Linear Regression ✔️
* Polynomial Regression
* Logistic Regression ✔️
* Support Vector Machines ✔️
* K-Nearest Neighbour ✔️
* Naive Bayes
* K-Means
* Neural Network ✔️
